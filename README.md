# Skyculator
Skyculator is an Android app designed to calculate the risk factor of a skydiver based on weight and parachute size. The app is currently in development and still evolving.<br>

ðŸš§ Work in Progress<br>
This project serves as both a functional app and a creative space for exploration. Some files in the repository may be unused or experimental, as I also use this project as a canvas for testing and refining my UI/UX design skills.<br>
