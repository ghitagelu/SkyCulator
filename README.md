# Skyculator
Skyculator is an Android app designed to calculate the risk factor of a skydiver based on weight and parachute size. The app is currently in development and still evolving.

ðŸš§ Work in Progress
This project serves as both a functional app and a creative space for exploration. Some files in the repository may be unused or experimental, as I also use this project as a canvas for testing and refining my UI/UX design skills.

Features (So Far)
âœ… Risk calculation based on weight and parachute size
âœ… Functional UI and calculations
ðŸš§ Design improvements in progress
ðŸš§ Codebase cleanup pending

Future Plans
UI/UX refinements
Additional risk factors
Performance optimizations
